A ROS wrapper over the AirSim C++ **Car** client library. This code is based on the [original AirSim ROS wrapper for the *Multirotor* API](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/tree/master/ros/src/airsim_ros_interface) and provides an interface between AirSim + Unreal Engine and your ros-based autonomous system.
